Cryptoglyph-Necrotek Roadmap

This document tracks planned upgrades, structural improvements, and known issues for Cryptoglyph-Necrotek.

Current Version: v1.0.0

Known Issues
K1 — Connector Geometry Refinement

Status: Open
Priority: Medium

Description

The bottom-arc connector is functionally correct but requires further refinement for optimal visual balance.

Observed Behavior

Slight visual heaviness at higher stroke widths

Minor proportional imbalance between arc and oval

Connector spacing sensitivity in dense column layouts

Planned Improvements

Micro-offset tuning based on stroke width

Normalize arc-to-oval proportions

Refine vertical spacing for consistent flow

Evaluate optional alternate connector style

Planned Updates
v1.1.0 — Numbers & Punctuation Expansion

Goal: Achieve full sentence and numeric support.

1. Expanded Punctuation Set

Add glyph support for:

! Exclamation

? Question mark

: Colon

; Semicolon

' Apostrophe

" Quotation marks

- Dash / Hyphen

( ) Parentheses

Acceptance Criteria

All punctuation renders correctly in Canvas

SVG export matches Canvas output

Spacing rules remain consistent

No connector behavior applied to punctuation

2. Numeric Glyph System (0–9)

Add glyph definitions for digits:

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Design Requirements

Inline placement (not stacked)

No connector linking between digits

Consistent vertical rhythm with letter glyphs

Compatible with column wrap mode

Acceptance Criteria

Numbers render anywhere in text

SVG export parity maintained

No layout corruption

3. Symbol Layer Expansion

Initial symbol support candidates:

@ # $ % & * + =

/ \ _

[ ] { } < >

Acceptance Criteria

Unsupported characters degrade gracefully

Optional placeholder glyph for unknown characters

Structural Improvements (Post v1.1)
Data-Driven Glyph Architecture

Refactor glyph definitions into a structured format to:

Reduce manual geometry duplication

Improve maintainability

Simplify adding punctuation and symbols

Ensure Canvas and SVG share a single glyph definition source

Export Controls Enhancement

Planned additions:

Transparent vs solid background toggle (PNG)

Export scale multiplier

SVG stroke scaling toggle

Version Targets
Version	Focus
v1.0.0	Initial public release
v1.1.0	Numbers + punctuation
v1.2.x	Symbol expansion + connector refinement
v1.3.x	Structural refactor + export improvements
Long-Term Vision

Fully extensible glyph definition engine

Multiple connector styles

Glyph preview palette

Themed rendering presets

Advanced export configuration
